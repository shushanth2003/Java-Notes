# Object Orientation Programming

## why we using oops ? 
* Before Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), most programs used a procedural approach, where the focus was on writing step-by-step functions. This made it harder to manage and reuse code in large applications.
* To overcome these limitations, Object-Oriented Programming was introduced. Java is built around OOPs, which helps in organizing code using classes and objects.

## class
A Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. Using classes, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times. In general, class declarations can include these components in order:

* Modifiers: A class can be public or have default access (Refer to this for details).
* Class name: The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
* Body: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.

## Object
An Object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. The objects are what perform your code, they are the part of your code visible to the viewer/user. An object mainly consists of:

* State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
* Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
* Identity: It is a unique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.
* Method: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller.

## Abstraction
Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the essential details or features to the user. It allows to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. The unnecessary details are not displayed to the user.
