# Object Orientation Programming

## why we using oops ? 
    ** Before Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), most programs used a procedural approach, where the focus was on writing step-by-step functions. This made it harder to manage and reuse code in large applications.
    ** To overcome these limitations, Object-Oriented Programming was introduced. Java is built around OOPs, which helps in organizing code using classes and objects.
